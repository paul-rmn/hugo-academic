This should work fine now.
This is a test. Let's talk about complex numbers.

\begin{equation}
x^2+2x+3=4
\end{equation}


The complex plane is the set of pairs or real numbers $(x,y)$ written as $x+iy$
can also be written as matrices (did you know that?)
$$
x+iy=\begin{pmatrix}
x & -y\\ y&x
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
Guys, I think we have it!


Na aula passada, vimos que toda função analítica pode ser escrita como
$f=g+ih$ onde $g$ e $h$ sao harmônicas

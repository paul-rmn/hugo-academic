If \$F\$ is totally real, and \$\textbackslash Pi\$ and \$\textbackslash pi\$ are tempered everywhere, we deduce simultaneous non-vanishing of these \$L\$-values for certain sequences of \$\textbackslash sigma\$ with conductor tending to infinity in the level aspect and bearing certain local conditions.},

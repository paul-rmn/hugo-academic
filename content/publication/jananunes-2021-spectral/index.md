abstract: We prove a reciprocity formula for the average of the product of Rankin--Selberg
  $L$-functions $L(1/2, Pi times widetilde sigma)L(1/2, sigma times widetilde pi)$
  as $ sigma$ varies over automorphic representations of $ mathrmPGL(n)$ over a number
  field $F$, where $ Pi$ and $ pi$ are cuspidal automorphic representations of $ mathrmPGL(n+1)$
  and $ mathrmPGL(n-1)$ over $F$, respectively. If $F$ is totally real, and $ Pi$
  and $ pi$ are tempered everywhere, we deduce simultaneous non-vanishing of these
  $L$-values for certain sequences of $ sigma$ with conductor tending to infinity
  in the level aspect and bearing certain local conditions.

abstract: In this paper, we prove strong subconvexity bounds for self-dual GL$(3)$
  $L$-functions in the $t$-aspect and for GL$(3)$ $times$ GL(2) ~$L$-functions in
  the GL$(2)$-spectral aspect. The bounds are strong in the sense that they are the
  natural limit of the moment method pioneered by Xiaoqing Li, modulo current knowledge
  on estimate for the second moment of GL$(3)$ ~$L$-functions on the critical line.
